=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple interface to the API of TheyWorkForYou.com.

The actual core class, C<WebService::TWFY::API> is a subsclass of C<LWP::UserAgent> so you
are able to tweak all the normal options such as timeout etc. The UserAgent identifier however
is hardcoded to "WebService::TWFY::API module". This does not provide any personal information to
the API. However, it helps them track and monitor usage of the API service from this module.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new> 

The following constructor method creates C<WebService::TWFY::API> object and returns it.

  my $rh = { key => 'ABC123' };

  my $api = WebService::TWFY::API->new( $rh ) ;

The API now requires a key, you can obtain one at L<http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/key>.
The key above will not work, its only used as an example.

In future versions, if needed, it will support specifying the version of the API you wish to use.

=item C<execute_query>

Internal function which executes a request and blesses the response 
into a C<WebService::TWFY::Response> object.

=item C<query>

Creates a new C<WebService::TWFY::Request> request object and executes it with the parameters specified.

  my $rv = $api->query ( 'getConstituency', { 'postcode' => 'W128JL'
                                              'output'   => 'xml',
                                             } ) ;
  
  or

  my $rv = $api->query ( 'getMP', { 'postcode' => 'W128JL'
                                    'output'   => 'js',
                                  } ) ; 
                                            

  abstract :
  
  my $rv = $api->query ( function, { parameter1 => value, 
                                     parameter2 => value,
                                     ...  
                                   } ) ;

For a complete list of functions supported by the API, visit L<http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api>. 
Current output methods supported at the moment are B<XML> (xml), B<JS> (js), B<php> (php) and B<RPC over Anything But XML> (rabx).
This essentially returns a C<WebService::TWFY::Response> object, which is a C<HTTP::Response> subclass 
with some additional keys in place:

=over

=item * 
I<is_success>   : 0 or 1

=item *
I<results>      : results returned from the API

=item *
I<error_code>   : the error code (if any)

=item *
I<error_message> : the error message (if any)
